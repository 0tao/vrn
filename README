Description:

 This is an unguided version of the Volumetric Regress Network (VRN)
 for 3D face reconstruction from a single image. This method
 approaches the problem as a segmentation problem, producing a 3D
 volume which is spatially aligned with the input image.

 The included AFLW images are taken from 3DDFA [1]. We do not own
 these images, so we have only included a few as an example. If you
 like, you can download the dataset from their website and process all
 of the images in one go.

 The only difference between this and the method described in the
 paper is that our network was trained with hollow mouths. We feel
 this makes the output look a little more realisitc. If you would like
 a model trained to produce the mouth filled in (as shown in the
 figures in the paper), please let Aaron know and we will provide
 this.

Requirements:

 A working installation of Torch7 is required. This can be installed
 easily on most platforms using [2]. You will also requried a
 reasonable CUDA capable GPU. We trained our method using NVIDIA Titan
 X. This unguided implementation needs about 1.2GB of video RAM in
 order to process the an image of 192x192. MATLAB is used to render
 the isosurface of the 3D volume, but other raw volumetric rendering
 programs also exist, which could be used instead.

 This project was developed on Fedora 23. It should work on any other
 distribution of Linux. I have no idea if it will work on Windows.

 Overview:

  Torch7 (+ nn, cunn, cudnn, image)
  MATLAB
  NVIDIA GPU (+ CUDA, CuDNN)

Usage:

 Run ./download.sh to download the network model.

 The easiest way to begin is to execute the run file from within
 MATLAB. There are some example images included in the examples
 directory, but you are welcome to try your own.

Using your own images:

 You can use your own images with this method, since no landmarks are
 required. However, while we trained with large variation in scale,
 please be aware that on very small or very large faces, the method
 may begin to produce poor results.

 All images are given to the network as 192x192, so it would be best
 to make sure your image is square before passing it to the network.

VRN Guided:

 We will eventually release VRN Guided, which include a facial
 landmark detector built into the network. Details will be added to
 this README file when things are ready.
